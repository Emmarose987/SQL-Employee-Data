# sql-employee-data

*Background* 

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this challenge, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:

-Data Engineering

-Data Analysis

*Tasks:*

-Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 

-Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 

-List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

-List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

-List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
